            <aside><p> <strong>Microsoft's Past</strong>
                Microsoft is a multinational computer technology corporation.
                Microsoft was founded on April 4, 1975,
                by Bill Gates and Paul Allen in Albuquerque, New Mexico.[1]
                <img id="Chicke-God"src="https://s.hdnux.com/photos/03/31/05/889214/6/1200x0.jpg">
                Its current best-selling products
                are the Microsoft Windows operating system;
                Microsoft Office, a suite of productivity software;
                Xbox, a line of entertainment of games, music,
                and video; Bing, a line of search engines; and Microsoft Azure,
                a cloud services platform.[2]
                In 1980, Microsoft formed a partnership with IBM to bundle Microsoft's
                operating system with IBM
                computers; with that deal, IBM paid Microsoft a royalty for every sale.
                In 1985, IBM requested Microsoft to develop a new
                operating system for their computers called OS/2. Microsoft produced that operating system,
                but also continued to sell their own alternative,
                which proved to be in direct competition with OS/2. Microsoft Windows 
                eventually overshadowed OS/2 in terms of sales. When Microsoft launched
                several versions of Microsoft Windows in the 1990s, they had captured
                over 90% market share of the world's personal computers.
                As of June 30, 2015, Microsoft has a global annual revenue of
                US$86.83 billion (~$109 billion in 2023)
                and 128,076 employees worldwide.[3] It develops, manufactures,
                licenses, and supports a wide range of
                software products for computing devices.[4][5][6]
